# FPGA-Finger-Snap-Morse-Decoder
The Snap Detection Timing Peripheral on the DE10 board is designed to detect the timing between finger snaps and translate the pattern of snaps into Morse code. This peripheral processes snap timings by converting them into dashes, dots, and spaces, which are then mapped to corresponding English alphabet letters (A-F) using a 7-segment display.
